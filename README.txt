This is a spaceship game that was inspired by "Tech Withn Tim" on youtube. 
He created the game and I was able to implement more creative aspects to it. 
The basic game he created had the battle ships and regular bullets to shoot. 
The game now has multiple sound effects, ice power up, super power up, fire ball shot, music,
starting screen, more animations, heal power up, etc. These are all add ons to the game that I created myself.
There is a assets folder that contains sound clips, music, and images that are all part of the project game.
